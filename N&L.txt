How outbreaks are managed by authorities:
Workers, state health officials,  or labratory personell.
Investigations start immediatley after the outbreak is reported
  1. Investigations must start immediatley because evidence can decrease the longer it is left unnoticed. 
Outbreak management plans are created, under consultation between professionals.
The data that professionals need to find is what the disease is, how it is transmitted from animal to animal (this includes humans)
or plant to plant, and population risk.
Suggested Approach steps:
1. Recognize outbreak and prepare an investigation
2. Verify diagnosis and confirm outbreak exists
3. Establish case definition and find cases.
4. Characterize outbreak by person place and time
5. Determine who is at risk
6. Develop hypothesis
7. Test hypothesis with facts
8. Carry out further studies
9. Implement control/ prevention measures
10. Communicate findings
